# basic_etl_on_the_largest_banks_in_the_world
In this project, we will create like an automated system to extract the list of the top 10 largest banks in the world ranked by market capitalization from Wikipedia. Further, the data needs to be transformed and stored in GBP, EUR, and INR as well. The processed information table is to be saved locally in a CSV format and as a database table. Finally, we will run some queries on the new database table to view its results.
